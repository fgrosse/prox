## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome (use pull requests). Before you start working on
a bigger feature its always best to discuss ideas in a new github issue. For each
pull request make sure that you covered your changes and additions with unit tests.

Please keep in mind that I might not always be able to respond immediately but I
usually try to react within the week â˜º.
